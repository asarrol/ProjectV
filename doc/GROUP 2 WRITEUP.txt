This project was a difficult one, altogether. The process to end up where we did, which even then was an imperfect state, was difficult and filled with errors and issues. Initially, understanding our MVC model, or usage of a controller that interacts behind the scenes and acts as a middleman between the model and the view for the User, was difficult to rationalize and create from the bare bones DotView skeleton we had. The dot view was a decent starting point for us to expand upon, but we had to read a lot about the supplied reading, PARTICULARLY the information regarding ecosystems. That became a critical part of our final design, as we incorporated concurrency and a lot of those components to create cells and “actors” within those cells to serve as the monsters in our virtual grid. Then, from there, using methods such as randomNeighbor() to instigate movement between these adjacent cells was much easier. From there, we departed even further from the initial skeleton that the dot view provided by incorporating multiple listeners, and state dependency in order to shift the monsters between protected and vulnerable states. All in all, it was quite a journey to reach the final state we’re at. Some problems we wish we could have had time to address and potentially conquer was the inclusion of a score count, and other UI issues. The concept of adding a score wouldn’t have been too difficult, as it could for example have been a component of onTouch(), but our unfamiliarity with messing with UI elements really held us back. Some more devotion to that subject would have been interesting to mess around with, and just to discover more aspects of Android Studio that were left untouched. All in all, Project 5 definitely pushed us the the limit.
